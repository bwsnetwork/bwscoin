// Immutable class that represents a treap data structure which is used to hold ordered
// key/value pairs using a combination of binary search tree and heap semantics.
//
// In other parts of the code base, we see a traditional implementation of the
// treap with a randomised priority.
//
// Note that this treap has been modified from the original in that the
// priority, rather than being a random value, is deterministically assigned the
// monotonically increasing block height.
//
// However what is interesting is that we see similar behaviour to the treap
// structure, because the keys themselves are totally randomised, degenerate
// cases of trees with a bias for leftness or rightness cannot occur.
//
// Do make note however, if the keys were not to be randomised, this would not
// be a structure which can be relied upon to self-balance as treaps do.
//
// What motivated this alteration of the treap priority was that it can be used
// as a priority queue to discover the elements at the smallest height, which
// substantially improves application performance in one critical spot, via
// use of ForEachByHeight.
//
// All operations which result in modifying the treap return a new version of
// the treap with only the modified nodes updated.  All unmodified nodes are
// shared with the previous version.  This is extremely useful in concurrent
// applications since the caller only has to atomically replace the treap
// pointer with the newly returned version after performing any mutations.  All
// readers can simply use their existing pointer as a snapshot since the treap
// it points to is immutable.  This effectively provides O(1) snapshot
// capability with efficient memory usage characteristics since the old nodes
// only remain allocated until there are no longer any references to them.
